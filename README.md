# new-year-countdown
An app that counts down how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds left until the new year starting from today's date. I was able to fetch the current date from any user's current location. I then converted days, hours, minutes, and seconds until January 1st from miliseconds since JavaScript automatically fetches time only in miliseconds. The setInterval feature updates the time every second so the countdown is live. Seconds are rounded to the nearest ten since the original result was in the form of a decimal integer.
